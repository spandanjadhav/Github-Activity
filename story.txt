Aidan and ethan were roommates and used to live on State street in Madison, Wisconsin in a lavish apartment with a great view. They both had a strong fondness for sandwiches, their 
all time favourite food. Luckily for them, Cheba Hut, on of the best sandwich shops was right across their apartment.They even had a view of it from their balcony! Soon they 
started noticing a biker gang pull up to Cheba Hut every night. The group consisted of 8-10 people who would all arrive on high end motorcycles with lighting on them. One would
be purple, other blue and so on. One night around 1 am they started hearing shouting.....
They looked out their window and saw the usual biker gang outside of Cheba Hut shouting amongst themselves. Ethan and Aidan were very intrigued because this was a fairly unusual event. They continued to watch out their window as tensions kept rising outside and more bikers started arriving. After an hour had passed, the conflict had still not been resolved and the yelling was even louder than it had been at the beginning.
